# Predicting-Income-Brackets-Using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms
## Description
This project analyzes the Adult Income dataset to predict whether an individual earns more or less than $50K per year. Various machine learning algorithms were implemented, including:

- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Support Vector Machines  
- Random Forest  

The **Random Forest model** achieved the highest accuracy of **86%**. The project showcases extensive **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **hyperparameter tuning** to enhance model performance. It demonstrates practical skills in supervised learning, model evaluation, and comparative analysis of machine learning techniques.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.   
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Explored multiple classification algorithms to identify the best-performing model.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized model parameters for better accuracy.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset
- **Name**: Adult Income Dataset  
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Description**: Contains demographic and income-related data for individuals.  

**Features**:  
- Age, Workclass, Education, Marital Status, Occupation, Race, Sex, Hours per Week, etc.  
- **Target Variable**: Income (>50K or <=50K).  

## Results
- **Best Model**: Random Forest  
- **Accuracy**: 86%  
- **Insights**:  
  - Education and Occupation are key predictors of income.  
  - Random Forest outperformed other models due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships.  

## Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook
